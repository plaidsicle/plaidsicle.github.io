title: About me
---

I am currently an Assistant Professor of Professional Writing at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, where I teach undergraduate courses in Technical Writing and Business Communication. I completed a PhD in Rhetoric and Composition at Purdue University in 2018. My research and teaching engage with online communities of participatory knowledge-making and creative work, particularly volunteer groups and projects. I’m also interested in intellectual property, remix culture, transdisciplinarity, and digital rhetorics.

Outside of academia, I’ve worked as a graphic designer, web developer, librarian, and editorial assistant. I am a member of the Board of Copy Editors for the Journal of Social Work Values & Ethics and <a href="https://librivox.org/reader/10603">I record audiobooks with LibriVox</a> when I can.
